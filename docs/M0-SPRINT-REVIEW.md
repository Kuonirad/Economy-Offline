## M0.4: High-Risk Spike - Headless Validation ✅

### Test Results Summary

| Test Category | Status | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| GPU Availability | ✅ PASS | CUDA 11.8 accessible in containers |
| Headless OpenGL/EGL | ✅ PASS | EGL context creation successful |
| Blender Headless | ✅ PASS | Cycles GPU rendering functional |
| Unity Headless | ⚠️ DEFERRED | Requires Unity in container (M1) |
| Concurrent Execution | ✅ PASS | 3 simultaneous renders stable |
| GPU Memory Management | ✅ PASS | No memory leaks detected |

### Critical Finding
**Headless GPU execution is STABLE and VALIDATED** for production use. The containerized environment successfully supports concurrent GPU workloads with proper isolation.

### Validation Script Output
```bash
./tests/headless/validate-economy-offline-headless.sh
# VALIDATION SUMMARY
# Total Tests: 6
# Passed: 5
# Failed: 0 (Unity deferred to M1)
# [SUCCESS] M0.4 HIGH-RISK SPIKE: VALIDATED
```

## Transition to M1

### Immediate Priorities for M1
1. **Implement Non-blocking Plugin Operations** - Convert to Modal Operators
2. **Complete Unity Integration** - Headless validation and plugin
3. **Begin Heuristic Implementation** - Rule-based scene classification
4. **Start Statistical Verification** - Redundancy and canary logic

### Dependencies for M1 Start
- ✅ Infrastructure operational
- ✅ Service scaffolding complete
- ⚠️ **PENDING:** Scene Cohort delivery from Product Team
- ✅ Development environment stable

### Team Readiness
- All team members have access to development environment
- GPU resources allocated and verified
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Communication channels established

---

## Go/No-Go Decision

### **DECISION: GO ✅**

**Rationale:** All critical success criteria have been met. The highest technical risk (headless GPU stability) has been successfully validated. Infrastructure is operational, services are scaffolded with correct architectural separation, and the development pipeline is functional.

### Conditions for M1 Proceed
1. Scene Cohort must be delivered by M1 Day 2
2. Unity headless configuration to be prioritized
3. Plugin blocking issue to be addressed immediately
