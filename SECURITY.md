## Security Architecture Overview

Our distributed system presents unique attack surfaces requiring specialized security considerations:

### **Core Components Under Security Governance:**
- **Authoring Plugin ("Optimizer")** - Unity/Blender integration with scene analysis
- **Verification Pipeline ("Trust Engine")** - Cross-node consensus and probabilistic verification

- **Economy Offline Pipeline** - Time-shifted optimization and quality assurance

### **Primary Security Domains:**
1. **Distributed GPU Computing Security** - Node authentication, resource isolation
2. **Rendering Pipeline Integrity** - Scene asset verification, output validation  
3. **Cross-Node Consensus Security** - Byzantine fault tolerance, verification attacks
4. **Data Privacy Protection** - Scene asset confidentiality, proprietary algorithm protection
